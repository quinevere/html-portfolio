<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a beginner software developer with a knack for turning code into creativity. While mastering the latest programming languages,  also finds joy in dancingâ€”where the rhythm of the beat mirrors the flow of lines of code. When not tapping away at a keyboard or on the dance floor, I can find myself diving into health books, experimenting with new cooking recipes, and creating delicious, nutritious meals. </p>
<p>I believes that a healthy body fuels a sharp mind, and I love sharing tasty meals with friends. Always eager to learn and grow, I embraces every challenge with a smile, proving that every great developer started as a beginner. With a curious spirit and a passion for movement, I make the journey to success a fun and flavorful adventure.</p>
